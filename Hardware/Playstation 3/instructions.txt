!!EXPLOIT IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY!!

Usage Instructions:

Compile and run the kernel module.

When the "PRESS THE BUTTON IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS" comes on, pulse the line circled in the picture low for ~40ns.
Try this multiple times, I rigged an FPGA button to send the pulse.
Sometimes it kernel panics, sometimes it lv1 panics, but sometimes you get the exploit!!
If the module exits, you are now exploited.

This adds two new HV calls,
u64 lv1_peek(16)(u64 address) 
void lv1_poke(20)(u64 address, u64 data)
which allow any access to real memory.

The PS3 is hacked, its your job to figure out something useful to do with it.
