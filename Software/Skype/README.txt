This package contains deobfuscated, unpacked skypekit binaries for Windows and x86_Linux + SDK
All anti-debugging code was removed so feel free to explore binaries.

Runtimes was a little bit fixed so it makes a handshake with Skype authorization server just like a regular desktop client for Windows.
That means you don't need to request any certificate to use it.
Btw, package contains termless keypair.pem file but it is intended only for compatibility with SDK.
Even if this key will be revoked by Skype, runtime will work as usual because the key is not involved in handshake process.

The "-d" option now writes clear debug log (only for 3.7.0) in vanilla skypekit the logs are obfuscated.
